# Xrm LiveUpdate

Xrm LiveUpdate tries to simplify 'scripting' for DataVerse Model Driven apps by eliminating all the plumping (getting attributes, attaching and removing event handlers, hiding or showing fields) so we are mostly left with only business logic.

It was inspired by react, implementing the business logic as render functions and by home assistant templates and how de detect dependencies on states.
